## 2048 Game By Speech

***In order to play this game, you should know how to say **up**, **down**, **left**, **right** in Vietnamese.***
After hearing the sound ***beep***, you must choose your turn immediately. ***BE FAST*** You have only one second for each move, otherwise, a random direction will be choosen.
